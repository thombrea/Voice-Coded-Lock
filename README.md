# Voice Coded Lock
 
Senior design project for ECE445, made by Aman Thombre and Logan Greuel. We created a hands-free, automatic door lock that operates when given a spoken password. When a user says the word "hamster," the door unlocks, and if the door hears any other noise, word, or phrase, the door remains locked. This repo contains all the code/datasets used to make the speech recognition model.
